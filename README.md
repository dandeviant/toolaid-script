# toolaid - Python script for Debian-based Linux distros
Repo for toolaid

toolaid is my first very own Python-based scripts for Linux \
I write this script as a personal project of mine during breaks and boredoms xoxo. \
I created toolaid to help newbies like me to run Linux basic tools and shell commands. \
I don't hope for outside contributions, but I appreciate if there's any :)
